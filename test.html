  <h1>Our Filmy Love Story 💛</h1>
  <h2>From a simple request… to forever.</h2>

  <p>It started with something so ordinary… A single request sent on Jeevansathi.
    No violins. No background music. Just a quiet hope in my heart.</p>

  <p>You accepted. And then… nothing.
    Like a typical Bollywood interval twist, you appeared… but stayed distant.
    I kept wondering — <span class="highlight">Is he interested? Or am I just another profile?</span></p>

  <p>Then destiny decided our story needed to move forward.
    We exchanged numbers. The texting began.</p>

  <p>We ran out of topics often… until cricket saved us.
    Match predictions turned into laughter.
    Score discussions turned into playful arguments.
    And somewhere between overs and innings… we began discovering each other.</p>

  <p>Our first meeting was on Holi.
    My heart was the most colorful thing that day — nervous, excited, terrified.
    But the moment I saw you… everything softened.
    It didn’t feel unfamiliar anymore. It felt right.</p>

  <p>Our second meeting happened on Gudi Padwa — a day of new beginnings.
    You traveled all the way just to drop me home.
    A simple gesture… but in my heart, it played like a grand romantic scene.
    That day, I felt chosen.</p>

  <p>Our third meeting needed no dramatic dialogue.
    Just eyes saying what words didn’t have to.</p>

  <p>Soon our families met. Smiles were exchanged.
    Conversations flowed as if this was always meant to be.
    And before we could process it, our marriage was fixed — like a script finally revealed.</p>

  <p>Our first movie. Our first kiss.
    Time didn’t just slow down… it paused.</p>

  <p>That random late-night visit?
    Four hours that felt like an entire lifetime.
    The two people who once ran out of topics were now talking endlessly — about dreams, fears, and forever.</p>

  <p>June 4th — our engagement.
    June 8th — our wedding day.</p>

  <p>When you held my hand during the ceremony, the chaos inside me became calm.
    That wasn’t just a hand I was holding.
    <span class="highlight">It was my home. My partner. My forever.</span></p>

  <p>Nine months into marriage, and love hasn’t faded — it has deepened.
    If life rewrote my story a thousand times,
    I would still send that request.
    I would still wait through the silence.
    I would still choose you. Every single time.</p>

  <div class="ending">
    I love you, my babboo. 💛✨<br>
    Not just for this lifetime… but for every lifetime after.
